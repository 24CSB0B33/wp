  <p>Historical places in Agra are some of the most significant sites of India. Mostly during the Mughal Period. Situated on the banks of the river Yamuna, this beautiful city gained public interest when Sikander Lodhi decided to make Agra the capital city. It remained the capital city even during the reign of Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. It was during the Mughal Period when Agra gained some of the incredible monuments like the Taj Mahal, Buland Darwaza and the Agra Fort. Agra’s influence declined when Mughal’s influence declined. By this time, the British had attained significant power. Agra came under British control in the 1800s. With the capital city being changed to Capital city, Agra lost the powerful significance it held during the Mughal Period. After independence, Agra developed into an industrial city and a popular tourist destination. Some of the famous monuments were also listed under UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites.</p>

  <p>Hampi is an ancient South Indian Village well known for its stone temples. Nestled in the rocky terrains in Bellary district of Karnataka, Hampi is today a UNESCO World Heritage site. The stone temples and ruins are a memory of the affluent history and culture of the place. Hampi was the capital of the Vijaynagara dynasty. The city flourished under the reign of Krishnadevaraya. During its finest days, Hampi was known to be one of the wealthiest cities in India. Its wealth and grandeur was well known across the country and abroad and attracted the attention of traders from Portugal and Persia. The witty Tenali Rama was one of the ministers in the court of Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire. Consequently, there are plenty of places to visit in Hampi that are sure to catch your eye!

The glory of Vijaynagara was brought to an end by the joint coalition of Muslim Sultanates who later plundered and pillaged the riches as well as the city, leaving behind ruins to tell its tale of a glorious past. Today, the ruins attract a lot of travellers, historians, art enthusiasts, archaeology and geology enthusiasts. Hampi and places to visit around its vicinity still resonate the same old opulence and bounty.</p>

  <p>Historical Places in Maharashtra are plenty and will take you back in times giving your holiday the much required thrill. If you love architectural brilliance and want to have a unique experience, then visiting the Gateway of India should be ideal for you. And while you are at it, you can visit the famous Elephanta Caves, too. It has been tagged as a World Heritage Site recently and is located pretty close to the Gateway of India as well.

Aside from the well-established architecture, the monuments of Maharashtra are worth visiting too! As an aficionado, you will love the constructional brilliance of Chand Minar, which is located near Daulatabad. In addition to it, the Bibi ka Maqbara is also a must-visit for you, if you are visiting the city for the first time. This beautiful monument has a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal and, therefore, offers a sublime vibe of romanticism to the visitors!</p>
